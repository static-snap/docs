## Introduction

Extensions in Static Snap allow you to expand its capabilities by adding custom features or integrating with third-party services. These extensions are developed in PHP and designed to be modular, enabling easy customization of the static site generated by Static Snap. This guide will help you get started with creating your own extensions to tailor Static Snap to your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

Before creating an extension for Static Snap, make sure you have the following:

- **Proficiency in PHP**: Since extensions for Static Snap are written in PHP, you should have a solid understanding of PHP programming and WordPress development.
- **WordPress Setup**: Ensure that you have WordPress installed with Static Snap enabled to test your extension in a real-world environment.
- **Development Environment**: A local development setup with tools like XAMPP, MAMP, or Local by Flywheel can make the development process smoother.

## Getting Started

To create an extension for Static Snap, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up the Extension

- **Create a PHP File**: Start by creating a PHP file for your extension, such as `my-custom-extension.php`, within the `wp-content/plugins/static-snap-extensions/` directory.
- **Extend the Base Class**: Your extension should extend the `StaticSnap\Extension\Extension_Base` class, which provides the necessary structure and hooks for integration.

### 2. Example Code Structure

Below is a basic template for creating a Static Snap extension in PHP:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Custom Search Extension for Static Snap
 *
 * @package StaticSnap
 */

namespace StaticSnap\CustomExtension;

use StaticSnap\Extension\Extension_Base;
use StaticSnap\Config\Options;

/**
 * Class My_Custom_Extension
 * A sample extension that adds search capabilities to the static site.
 */
class My_Custom_Extension extends Extension_Base {

    /**
     * Check if the extension is enabled
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function is_enabled(): bool {
        $options = Options::instance()->get('custom_extension.is_enabled', ['enabled' => false]);
        return $options['enabled'];
    }

    /**
     * Get the name of the extension
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function get_name(): string {
        return 'my_custom_extension';
    }

}
