## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- **Install the Static Snap Plugin**: A complete guide on how to [install the Static Snap plugin on your WordPress site is available here](/en/install-and-setup/).
- **Access to the WordPress Admin Panel**: Ensure you have administrative access to the WordPress site you want to convert to static.
- **Basic WordPress Knowledge**: Familiarity with installing plugins and navigating the WordPress admin interface is helpful.
- **Optional - Hosting or Deployment Platform**: Decide where you will host the static version of your site (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosting).
- **Optional - GitHub **: A GitHub account if you plan to use GitHub for automated backups or deployment.

With these prerequisites met, you’re ready to proceed with the installation of Static Snap.



## Basic Setup and Configuration

After installing the plugin, Static Snap will create a default Production environment that can be customized in the **Static Snap > Environments** section.
